Step 2: Find faults, keep improving. 
* Precipitation y-axis: unit inches, align top with tick label.
* Precipitation normal line. 
* Precipitation y = 4 line missing. 
* Precipitation notations.
* Halve margin between top and bottom graphs.
* Legend.
* Temperature & Precipitation comments.
* Code is a mess and not generalized. <-- Must fix. 
* Add comments.
